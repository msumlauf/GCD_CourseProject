# GCD Course Project - Code Book

A thorough description of the variables contained in the data files created by this project, as well as a brief outline of the processing steps that created them from the available input files.

## Study Design

All data processing steps are contained in a single R script called run_analysis.R.

This script expects 6 input files (with relative path names):

1) features.txt
2) activity_labels.txt
3) test/x_test.txt
4) test/y_test.txt
5) train/x_train.txt
6) train/y_train.txt
